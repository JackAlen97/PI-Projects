nowadays social media is a priority in our lives, most people their life is built on social media which refer to advantages and disadvantages. some of these disadvantages: Designed to be portable, the Possibility of image theft, The privacy of the images is collective, not individual, Content, Addictive, and Depends on the images: the popularity of an account is largely based on the quality of the published images. If the photos are not attractive enough, then the account will not have as many followers. the content on the other social media apps are most likely to be 18+
